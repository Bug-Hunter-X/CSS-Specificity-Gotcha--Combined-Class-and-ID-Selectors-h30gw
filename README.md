# CSS Specificity Gotcha: Combined Class and ID Selectors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS specificity issue where a combination of class and ID selectors unexpectedly overrides other selectors. This can lead to unexpected styling behavior in web applications.

## The Problem

The issue arises when you have multiple selectors targeting the same element, specifically when you combine class and ID selectors. The specificity of such selectors is higher than you might anticipate, sometimes leading to unintended overrides.

## The Code

The file `bug.css` contains a CSS code snippet that showcases this problem. The element with id `container` has a width specified by a selector with a high specificity overriding the expected behavior.

## The Solution

The file `bugSolution.css` provides a possible solution. This demonstrates how to adjust the CSS to produce expected results and avoid unexpected overriding.
