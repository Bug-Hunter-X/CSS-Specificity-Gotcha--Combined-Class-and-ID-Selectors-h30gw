The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.container {
  width: 100px;
}

#container {
  width: 200px;
}

.container #container {
  width: 300px;
}
```

The expected behavior might be that the element with the ID `container` would override the class selector `.container`, leading to a width of 200px. However, due to the high specificity of the selector `.container #container`, which combines both class and ID selectors, this selector overrides both the class and the ID selectors. As a result, the element will have a width of 300px.
